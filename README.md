# Readme
My name is Nuttha Laosakulrath. I am a student from the ICT faculty, Mahidol University. I am the one interested in technology since I was studying in high school. I always read news about technology because I like to learn new things and want to develop it by myself. In the future, I want to be a Network Engineer or IT support. I am able to troubleshoot and fix the problems whether programs or people as I have good communication skill, sensibility and also mediate between people to people.
